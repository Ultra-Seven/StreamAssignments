% Using Proton, the application developer declaratively specifies each gesture as a regular expression over a stream of touch events. Proton statically analyzes the set of gestures to report conflicts, and it automatically creates gesture recognizers for the entire set.

Proton contributes a graphical editor for authoring tablatures and automatically compiles tablatures into regular expressions.

Second, it combines an extensible template-based gesture recognizer with a specialized handwriting recognizer to even better address handwriting-based gestures, which are a common form of gesture shortcut.

% Most interactions fall into one of two modalities: 1) direct touch and multi-touch (by hand and by tangibles) directly on the surface, and 2) hand gestures above the surface.  We first contribute a unification of these discrete interaction modalities called the continuous interaction space. Our second contribution illustrates this, where we introduce a variety of interaction categories that exploit the space between these modalities.

% We investigate the differences -- in terms of both quantitative performance and subjective preference -- between direct-touch and mouse input for unimanual and bimanual tasks on tabletop displays. The results of two experiments show that for bimanual tasks performed ontabletops, users benefit from direct-touch input. However,our results also indicate that mouse input may be more appropriate for a single user working on tabletop tasks requiring only single-point interaction.

%DEFOG was designed to manipulate objects and as such, it is able to handle a wide range of data types. In addition, it allows flexible data manipulation through both visual and programmatic operations, all integrated in the same environment. By allowing both objects and their relationships to be displayed and combined, DEFOG provides great freedom for visual composition. To that end, it combines information visualization with infrastructure to support a variety of data including in-memory objects and operations found in vector-based graphics editors like select, move, scale, group, and copy-and-paste.

%--------------------------------------------------Query Refinement & Relaxation & Steering Others--------------------------------------%
% This chapter proposes two new algorithms for query relaxation.  The first algorithm addresses the problem of response times for computing user-optimal relaxations in interactive recommendation sessions. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of different techniques like partial evaluation of subqueries, precomputation of query results and compact in-memory data structures. The second algorithm is an improvement of previous approaches to mixed-initiative failure recovery: Instead of computing all minimal ‘conflicts’ within the user requirements in advance – as suggested in previous algorithms – we propose to determine preferred conflicts ‘on demand’ and use a recent, general-purpose and fast conflict detection algorithm for this task

%In this paper, we describe new techniques for the fast computation of ‘user-optimal’ query relaxations.First, we show how the number of required database queries for determining an optimal relaxation can be limited to the number of given subqueries by evaluating the subqueries individually. Next, it is described how the problem of finding relaxations returning ‘at-least-n’ products can be efficiently solved by analyzing these partial query results in memory. Finally, we show how a general-purpose conflict detection algorithm can be applied for determining ‘preferred’ conflicts in interactive relaxation scenarios.

% In this paper, we propose a framework to systematically relax queries involving joins and selections. We first characterize the types of answers that we return to relaxed queries. We then propose a lattice based framework in order to aid query relaxation. Nodes in the lattice correspond to different ways to relax queries. We characterize the properties of relaxation at each node and present algorithms to compute the corresponding answer. We then discuss how to traverse this lattice in a way that a non-empty query answer is obtained with the minimum amount of query condition relaxation.

%This paper proposes a two-step solution to address the diversity issue of user preferences for the categorization approach. The proposed solution does not require explicit user involvement. The first step analyzes query history of all users in the system offline and generates a set of clusters over the data, each corresponding to one type of user preferences. When user asks a query, the second step presents to the user a navigational tree over clusters generated in the first step such that the user can easily select the subset of clusters matching his needs.

The user is then guided in the selection of the most useful attribute, and associated constraint, to be eliminated from her query at each stage of an incremental relaxation process.
