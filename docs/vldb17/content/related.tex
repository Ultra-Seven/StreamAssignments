Prefetching: The Web~\cite{domenech2006web,nanopoulos2003data}
Databases have studied prefetching as part of client server~\cite{ramachandran2005dynamic,ramachandraholistic,sapia2000promise,smith1978sequentiality}, 
query execution for operators such as hash-join~\cite{chen2007improving}.
It has also been specifically studied in the context of data-driven visualization~\cite{jayachandran2014combining,battle2013scalar,battle2016dynamic,cetintemel2013query,debrabant2015seer}.

Predictive Models: mouse prediction~\cite{pasqual2014mouse,lane2005process,wobbrock2009angle,wobbrock2007gestures} has been well studied.
The web search community has a notion of query intent models~\cite{li2008learning} and has used mouse movement as a way for predicting which links a user will likely click on~\cite{guo2008exploring}.
The idea of a query intent model has been explored in databases in the context of shared scan processing~\cite{ebenstein2016fluxquery}.

Progressive Encoding: multi-resolution, wavelets, online aggregation.
Saliency models have potential.
